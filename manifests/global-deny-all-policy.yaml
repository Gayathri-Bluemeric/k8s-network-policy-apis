kind: GlobalNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: global-deny-all
spec:
  # order controls the precedence. Calico applies the policy with the lowest value first.
  # Kubernetes NetworkPolicy does not support order. They are automatically converted to an order 
  # value of 1000 by Calico. Setting this value to 2000, provides flexibility for 999 additional
  # GlobalNetworkPolicies to be added and ensures Kubernetes namespace-scoped policies always take
  # precedence.
  order: 2000

  - Ingress
  - Egress

  # Allow all egress traffic from kube-system.
